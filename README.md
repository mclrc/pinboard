A total Google-Keep ripoff that i made for practice. You will be able
to create notes and reminders. No libraries or frameworks were used.
Ripping off popular website is actually pretty fun and id recommend anyone
wanting to practice some webdesign to do the same. Might also be useful
to learn a new UI framework or something.
